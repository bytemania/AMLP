\section*{Abstract}

The prediction of stock market trends has long been a challenging yet critical task in 
financial analysis. Traditional statistical models often struggle to capture the nonlinear 
and volatile nature of financial markets, leading to the increasing adoption of deep learning 
techniques. This study explores the integration of machine learning models, specifically 
\acrfull{rnn}, \acrfull{lstm}, and \acrfull{gru}, for stock price prediction.

Experimental results will offer insights into the potential benefits and limitations of 
sentiment-enhanced financial prediction. This research contributes to the field of financial 
forecasting by evaluating the effectiveness of integrating deep learning with social media 
sentiment analysis and critically analyzing its impact on predictive performance.
