\section{Literature Review}

Stock market prediction using deep learning and machine learning techniques has been 
a widely researched area in financial forecasting. This section reviews key 
literature that explores the use of LSTM, hybrid models, and technical indicators 
in predicting stock market trends.

\subsection{Traditional Approaches to Stock Market Prediction}

Early methods of stock market prediction relied heavily on statistical models such as 
\acrfull{arima} and \acrfull{garch}. These models were useful for linear trend
analysis but struggled with capturing the non-linear and highly volatile nature of
financial time-series data~\parencite{guo2024LSTMStock}. Similarly, fundamental and
technical analyses have been widely used by traders, relying on financial ratios, 
market trends, and macroeconomic 
factors~\parencite{balasubramanian2023SystematicSurvey}. However, with the increasing
complexity of financial markets, these traditional models have become less effective
in predicting short-term stock movements.

\subsection{Machine Learning-Based Models for Stock Prediction}

With the advent of machine learning, various algorithms have been employed for stock price
forecasting, including \acrfullpl{svm}, \acrfullpl{rf}, and \acrfullpl{gbm} such as 
\emph{XGBoost}~\parencite{nabipour2020DeepLearning}. These models have demonstrated 
improved performance over 
traditional methods by learning complex patterns in stock price data. However, they often 
fail to capture long-term dependencies in time-series data, making them less effective in 
sequential forecasting tasks.

\citetitle{parmar2018stock}~\parencite{parmar2018stock} explored machine learning 
techniques for stock market 
prediction, highlighting the effectiveness of ensemble learning methods in combining 
multiple models for improved accuracy. While these methods enhance prediction performance,
they still rely on feature engineering and lack the ability to extract deep temporal 
patterns from stock price movements.

\subsection{Deep Learning for Stock Market Prediction}

Deep learning techniques, particularly \acrshortpl{rnn} and \acrshortpl{lstm}, have shown
significant improvements in time-series forecasting by retaining sequential dependencies in
data~\parencite{chang2024StockPrediction}. \acrshortpl{lstm} are designed to overcome
the vanishing 
gradient\footnote{The vanishing gradient problem occurs in deep neural networks when
gradients become too small during backpropagation, leading to ineffective weight updates 
and slow or stalled learning. This issue is especially prevalent in \acrshortpl{rnn}, 
where long-range dependencies are difficult to capture. \acrshortpl{lstm} address this by
incorporating gating mechanisms that regulate the flow of information, mitigating the
problem.} problem in \acrshortpl{rnn}, making them ideal for modeling long-term 
dependencies in stock price trends.

A comparative study by 
\citeauthor{nabipour2020DeepLearning}~\parencite{nabipour2020DeepLearning} showed 
that \acrshortpl{lstm} outperformed traditional \acrfull{ml} models such as \acrfullpl{dt}, and 
\acrshortpl{rf} in predicting stock price movements. 

\subsection{Hybrid Deep Learning Models: LSTM-GRU and Advanced Techniques}

Recent studies have explored hybrid models, integrating \acrshort{lstm} with 
\acrfullpl{bigru}\footnote{LSTM-BiGRU is a hybrid model that combines \acrshort{lstm} 
networks and \acrfullpl{bigru}. \acrshortpl{lstm} excel at capturing long-term dependencies in sequential
data, while \acrshortpl{bigru} process information in both forward and backward directions, enhancing
context awareness. This combination is particularly useful in time-series forecasting, improving
predictive accuracy and robustness in stock market prediction.} for improved predictive performance.
\acrshortpl{gru} simplify the \acrshort{lstm} structure while maintaining its memory retention
capabilities, leading to faster training times and better generalization~\parencite{guo2024LSTMStock}.
Other studies have investigated alternative combinations of deep learning and traditional models,
integrating techniques like \acrfull{xgboost} to enhance forecasting
accuracy~\parencite{agrawal2022StockPrediction}. Furthermore, the use of 
Facebook Prophet\footnote{Facebook Prophet is an open-source time-series forecasting tool developed by
Meta. It is designed to handle trends, seasonality, and holiday effects using an additive model. 
Prophet is particularly effective for stock market prediction as it can manage missing data, outliers,
and irregular time-series intervals, making it robust for financial forecasting and trend analysis.} and 
statistical techniques like \acrfull{arima}\footnote{\acrshort{arima} is a time-series forecasting model
that combines AutoRegression, Integration to remove trends, and Moving Average to smooth fluctuations.
It is commonly used for financial forecasting but struggles with highly volatile or non-linear
patterns.} in conjunction with deep learning models has been explored to balance short-term and 
long-term prediction needs~\parencite{phuoc2024StockPrediction}.

\subsection{Incorporating Technical Indicators in Stock Prediction Models}

Technical indicators play a crucial role in stock price forecasting by capturing momentum, volatility, 
and trend reversals. Several studies have incorporated technical indicators such as 
\acrshort{macd}, \acrshort{rsi}, \acrshort{bb}, and \acrshort{sma} into \acrshort{lstm}-based 
prediction models~\parencite{guo2024LSTMStock}.

\citetitle{phuoc2024StockPrediction}~\parencite{phuoc2024StockPrediction} applied \acrshort{macd}, 
\acrshort{rsi}, and \acrshort{sma} in an \acrshort{lstm} model and achieved a 93\% accuracy rate in
forecasting stock trends in the Vietnamese market.   

\citetitle{chang2024StockPrediction}~\parencite{chang2024StockPrediction} extended this approach by 
incorporating ensemble techniques, combining deep learning with statistical models like 
\acrshort{arima} and Facebook Prophet. This hybrid methodology improved prediction stability across
different market conditions, demonstrating the importance of integrating multiple forecasting 
techniques.

\subsection{Challenges}

Despite advancements in deep learning models for stock prediction, several challenges remain. One major
issue is \emph{overfitting}, where models perform well on historical data but fail to generalize 
to unseen market conditions. To mitigate this, studies have employed dropout techniques, 
\emph{L2 regularization}, and ensemble learning~\parencite{shaban2024SMPDL}.

Another challenge is the selection of optimal technical indicators, as not all indicators contribute 
equally to model performance. Future research should focus on automated feature selection techniques
and reinforcement learning-based approaches to dynamically adapt feature selection based on
real-time market conditions~\parencite{balasubramanian2023SystematicSurvey}.

Finally, \acrfull{hft} applications pose additional challenges due to the rapid nature
of stock price fluctuations. Studies such as \citeauthor{guo2024LSTMStock}~\parencite{guo2024LSTMStock}
emphasize the need for specialized deep learning models that can handle millisecond-level trading 
data, further pushing the boundaries of financial \acrfull{ai} research.
