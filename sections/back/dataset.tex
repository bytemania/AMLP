\subsection{Dataset Description}
\label{app:dataset}
The dataset was collected over a \emph{10-year period (2014â€“2024)} 
using Twelve Data API with a daily frequency (\emph{1-day interval}), providing a
comprehensive historical view of stock price movements. The data includes key financial
indicators that help analyze different aspects of the market:

\begin{description}
    \item[Pricing Data] Includes daily open, high, low, close, and volume (OHLCV) values,
    which serve as the foundation for tracking stock performance.
    \item[Trend Indicators] Measure the overall direction of the market, helping identify 
    whether a stock is in an uptrend, downtrend, or moving sideways.
    \item[Momentum Indicators] Evaluate the speed and strength of price movements, providing
    insights into potential trend reversals and whether the stock is overbought or oversold.
    \item[Volatility Indicators] Assess market risk and price fluctuations, helping traders 
    identify potential breakouts and periods of stability.
    \item[Volume Indicators] Analyze trading activity to confirm price trends, showing
    whether investors are accumulating (buying) or distributing (selling) a stock.
